# Stopwatch
Created a Stopwatch having hours , minutes , seconds and counter
# HTML
created 1 mega div and 2 small div to be utilize in css and js
gave them different ids to be connected easily with css and js
created in span tag because span is align in the same line of code
denoted class to contained as hr , mins , sec , count
count should be 100 = 1 sec thats why count is important in this project
created 3 buttons to use them via js named as: start , stop , reset
onclick event to these buttons so we dont need to add event listeners in js
# CSS
link html to css
start styling the whole project via css
body to 0 margin because there should be no space
targeted as each ids and classes to be styled in css
# Javascript
created different functions named as start , stop , reset and the main is "stopwatch"
created variables to 0 because counter always start from zero
timer function to "true" else "false"
start adding the main interacting codes in stopwatch function
then to "dual zero" created more variables because if we created on "start" the counter shows only "1" zero
start , stop , reset buttons are working 100%
